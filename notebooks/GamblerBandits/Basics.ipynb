Indeed while much of the material is similar, the style of a mini-course is quite different from the style of a survey. Also, bandit theory has surprisingly progressed since 2012 and many things can now be explained better. Finally in the survey we completely omitted the Bayesian model as we thought that we didn’t have much to add on this topic compared to existing sources (such as the 2011 book by Gittins, Glazebrook, Weber). For a mini-course this concern is irrelevant so I quickly discuss the famous Gittins index and its proof of optimality.\n",

Side note: by the minimax theorem this implies the existence of a strategy for the oblivious adversarial model with regret \\sqrt{T n \\log(n)} (of course we already proved that such a strategy exist, in fact we even constructed one via exponential weights, but the point is that the proof here does not require any “miracle” –yes exponential weights are kind of a miracle, especially when you consider how the variance of the unbiased estimator gets automatically controlled).\n",

    "    In the i.i.d. model UCB attains a regret of O \\left( \\sum_i \\frac{\\log(T)}{\\Delta_i}\\right) and by Lai and Robbins’ lower bound this is optimal (up to a multiplicative variance-like term).\n",
    "    In the adversarial model Exp3 attains a regret of O(\\sqrt{T n \\log(n)}) and this is optimal up to the logarithmic term.\n",
    "    In the Bayesian model, Gittins index gives an optimal strategy for the case of product priors. For general priors Thompson Sampling is a more flexible strategy. Its Bayesian regret is controlled by the entropy of the optimal decision. Moreover TS with an uninformative prior has frequentist guarantees comparable to UCB.\n",
