    "In this post, we will be making use of the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com) API to do reinforcement learning.

    "In the [previous post](avandekleut.github.io/q-learning/), we implemented Markov decision processes (MDPs) by hand, and showed how to implement $Q$-learning to create a greedy policy that significantly outperforms a random policy. The purpose of that post was to drive home the nitty gritty details of the mathematics of MDPs and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in reality, the environments that our agents live in are not described with an explicit transition matrix $\\mathcal{P}$. The MDP model is just used as a convenient description for environments where state transitions satisfy the Markov property. MDPs are useful because we can use them to prove that certain policy learning algorithms converge to optimal policies. \n",

    "In the general reinforcement learning paradigm, the agent only has access to the state $s_t$, the corresponding reward $r_t$, and the ability to choose an ation $a_t$. It does not have access to the underlyling state dynamics $\\mathcal{P}$ (usually because environments arent' actually implemented using a state transition matrix)."
